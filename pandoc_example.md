In the era of social media, many issues are brought into the limelight. One of the current issues in our sociaties is sexism. This conflict is often brought into the public eye as a behavioral issue or a progressive movement. However not a lot is said about the economical side of the issue. In 2013, The US president Barrack Obama issued the following statement about the gender wage gap *''Over the course of her career, a working woman with a college degree will earn on average ahundreds of thousands of dollars less than a man who does the same work''.* This statement sparkerd a lot of conroversy due to its false nature. But how does the market actually look like and is there an even playing field? [#] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WWzELjRfWA)

How big is the wage gap in the United States?
--------

The average gap between male and female salaries has been indicated to be around the 80% as the follwing table suggests.

However a study by Payscale [#] (http://www.payscale.com/career-news/2013/04/fallacy-of-the-gender-wage-gap) found a 2% difference in the wage gap between men and women. Most economists tend to agree with the notion that the wage gap is almost non-existing and that is has to do with multiple factors. 

What makes up the wages gap?
--------

The wage gap is created by a simplistic model which takes into account the overal earnings of men and women accross the United States. However the wage gap does not take into account differences in :

* Occcupations
* Educations
* Positions
* Hours worked per week
* Family expansion


These omitted variables would explain the 20 cent on-the-dollar wage gap in te United States. There are several studies that confirm this bias towards a high wage gap. In 2009, MBA graduates from the Chigaco Business School from 1990 until 2006 were examined. On year out of businessschool women were making 115.000 dollars, while men earned 130.000 dollars. Eight years later women were earning 250.000 on average, while men were earning 400.000 dollars on average. However in the later years the differences evened out. The anomalies came due to childbirth. Females often do more than men in the household, have to burden themselves with carrying the child for 9 months and are required to stay shortly after the birth of their child. The Harvard study found that the wage gap was twice as large for women with children, compared to women without any children.

Claudia Goldin, a Harvard researcher, examined the differences gender pay gaps within occupations. [#] (https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf) She found out that jobs in the business-sector were more seceptible to larger wage gaps. This is explained by the working hours needed for most of these jobs. Some clients might need more care than others and this could lead to a deviation from the standard nine to five system. As mentioned previously, children require care and attention too and this is often the mothers resposibilty. The opposite effect is observed with the pharmacy-branche. In the modern-era, most pharmacies are owned by large companies and most of them operate on a 24 hour basis. Women can rotate their shifts, a nightshift could provide as much for the boss as a nine to five shift. In this sector there is a wage gap of 8%, a significant decrease from jobs with flexible schedules.

Dr Warren Farrel examines the marriage gap and illustrates the effect which marriage has on the wage gap. The weekly earnings gap goes from 608 dollars for single men and 577 dollars for single women, to 936 for married men and 708 for married women. This takes into account the unpaid hours worked at home, in which the wife has a more dominant precense. [#] (https://zhenles.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/farrell-why-men-earn-more-the-startling-truth-behind-the-pay-gap-and-what-women-can-do-about-it.pdf) Differences in occupations were also explained. Mathemetics, IT,  Architecture, Enginering and Chief Executive jobs were dominated by men with a 3 to 1 ratio. However Healthcare and Education were dominated by women with a 3 to 1 ratio. The jobs dominated by men however, were higher paid jobs. Individuals within these occupations were earning 36% more than ones in Healthcare or Education. Men also work more hours. 25% of women work part-time compared to 12% with males. Men also work more overtime hours with 22% percent, compared to the 11% of females. The United States requires employers to pay their employees at least 1.5 times as much if they work overtime, which widens the wage gap even further.

Could there be any discrimination against women on the labor market?
--------

There is evidence for discrimination towards females. This is due to statistical discrimination or taste-based discrimination.  Taste-based discrimination covers the discriminatory viewpoints of:
* Customers
*  Employees
*  Employers

Customers have a preference to get served by male individuals, they would pay higher prices when served by males rather than if they were to get served by females. This would lead to unprofitability when female presence is apparent, which causes employers to hire men more often than women. Male employees in turn want to get a compensation when working with women because wages would be lower when there is a female presence. Adding just one female could influence the wages in such a way that the optimal allocation of workforce becomes a separation between man and women. Segregation causes a separate male and female workplace, which causes a gap between wages. Employers could also simply prefer male employees, based on a bias they have on males and females on the workforce.  [#] (https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&lr=&id=50qHcSNVVEMC&oi=fnd&pg=PP7&dq=becker+discrimination&ots=EQmTMbevEq&sig=3XJrYLRl8wX9xo19PeshqUQrs7c#v=onepage&q=becker%20discrimination&f=false)  Goldin and Rouse point out in a study, a phenomenon where males are preferred over women. However there is no difference if the characteristics of being a male and female are hidden, thus forcing employers to judge the applicant based on its skills. This explains the employers' preferences for men over women. [#] (http://www.nber.org/papers/w5903)
Company size and culture also matters. Affirmative action is a policy which resulted by government regulation that made sure that minorities would get hired. Women got hired more often than without affirmative action. The effect was significant, as it increased the amount of women in male dominated jobs by 8% to 20%.  [#] (https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/hiring/affirmativeact) [#] (http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/17/affirmative-action-has-helped-white-women-more-than-anyone/) Affermative action could also have some discriminatory effect itself. A study has shown that minorities under affermative action needed lower SAT-scores to get accepted for the same position. [#] (http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9072.html) This effect of reverse disrimination could lead to inequality between man and women based on effort and not on preferences as it was the case previously.

Can policy makers in the United States close the wage gap?
-
There are several ways to help bridge the wage gap besides applying affirmative action. The Paycheck Fairness Act could provide improvements to the Equal Pay Act. [#] (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s862/summary) [#] (https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm) The Equal Pay Act has not recieved an update since 1963. Supporters of this bill point out that it lead to closing the wage gap from 62% to 80%. However recent evidence suggest that men prefer more blue collar jobs and are more likely to participate in STEM (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields than women. STEM jobs have more working hours and higher salaries. The actual wage gap lies around 7%, when controlled for these omitted variables. One of the priorities of policy makers could be to incentivice young girls towards STEM-related career paths.  The Paycheck Fairness Act's core was to train women to negotiate their wages and to punish employees for openly discriminating on the wages based on their employees sex. These legistlations are outdated as this has become the standard for men and women alike. New reforms should be implemented which take into account individual choices made by both male and female employees and perhaps making some jobs more family friendly in term of benefits.

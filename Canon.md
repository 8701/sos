In the era of social media, many issues are brought into the limelight. One of the current issues in our societies is sexism. This conflict is often brought into the public eye as a behavioral issue or a progressive movement. However not a lot is said about the economical side of the issue. In 2013, The US president Barrack Obama issued the following statement about the gender wage gap *''Over the course of her career, a working woman with a college degree will earn on average hundreds of thousands of dollars less than a man who does the same work''.* This statement sparked a lot of controversy due to it context, depicting a field where every women earns 20% less without discussing the validity of the economics behind it. But how does the market actually look like and is there an even playing field? [#] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WWzELjRfWA)

How big is the wage gap in the United States?
--------

The average gap between male and female salaries has been indicated to be around the 80% as the following table suggests.

![](http://www.aauw.org/files/2016/09/the-simple-truth-figure-2-v2.jpg)

However, a study by Payscale [#] (http://www.payscale.com/career-news/2013/04/fallacy-of-the-gender-wage-gap) found a 2% difference in the wage gap between men and women, rather than the 20% wage gap depicted through the Census Bureau data, making the wage gap virtually nonexistent. This difference occurs when various variables are omitted. The government data works on averages and does not include factors like, career choices, education, experience or any other factor which may contribute to an individual’s pay.


What makes up the wages gap?
--------

The wage gap is elucidated by a simplistic model from Census data which takes into account the overall earnings of men and women across the United States. However, the wage gap does not consider differences in various omitted factors: Occupations, educations, positions, hours worked per week and family expansion. These omitted variables would explain the 20 cent on-the-dollar wage gap in the United States. There are several studies that confirm this bias towards a high wage gap. In 2009, MBA graduates from the Chicago Business School from 1990 until 2006 were examined. One year out of business school women were making 115.000 dollars, while men earned 130.000 dollars. Eight years later women were earning 250.000 on average, while men were earning 400.000 dollars on average. However, in the later years the differences evened out. The anomalies came due to childbirth. Females often do more than men in the household, must burden themselves with carrying the child for 9 months and are required to stay shortly after the birth of their child. The Harvard study found that the wage gap was twice as large for women with children, compared to women without any children. [#] (http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/dynamics_of_the_gender_gap_for_young_professionals_in_the_financial_and_corporate_sectors.pdf)

Claudia Goldin, a Harvard researcher, examined the differences gender pay gaps within occupations. [#] (https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf) She found out that jobs in the business-sector were more susceptible to larger wage gaps. This is explained by the working hours needed for most of these jobs. Some clients might need more care than others and this could lead to a deviation from the standard nine to five system. As mentioned previously, children require care and attention too and this is often the mothers’ responsibility. The opposite effect is observed with the pharmacy industry. In the modern-era, most pharmacies are owned by large companies and most of them operate on a 24-hour basis. Women can rotate their shifts. A nightshift could provide as much for the boss as a nine to five shift. In this sector, there is a wage gap of 8%, a significant decrease from jobs with flexible schedules.

Dr Warren Farrel examines the marriage gap and illustrates the effect which marriage has on the wage gap. The weekly earnings gap goes from 31 dollars, 608 dollars for single men and 577 dollars for single women, to 228 dollars, 936 for married men and 708 for married women. This takes into account the unpaid hours worked at home, in which the wife has a more dominant presence. [#] (https://zhenles.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/farrell-why-men-earn-more-the-startling-truth-behind-the-pay-gap-and-what-women-can-do-about-it.pdf) Differences in occupations were also explained. Mathematics, IT, Architecture, Engineering and Chief Executive jobs were dominated by men with a 3 to 1 ratio. However, Healthcare and Education were dominated by women with a 3 to 1 ratio. The jobs dominated by men however, were higher paid jobs. Individuals within these occupations were earning 36% more than ones in Healthcare or Education. Men also work more hours. 25% of women work part-time compared to 12% with males. Men also work more overtime hours with 22% percent, compared to the 11% of females. The United States requires employers to pay their employees at least 1.5 times as much if they work overtime, which widens the wage gap even further. [#] (https://www.dol.gov/whd/overtime_pay.html) 

Results of a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis shows that the wage gap was decreased by increasing the experience in the labor market, increasing the working hours and increasing the years of education received. This confirms the theory that omitted variables based on preferences and the number of working hours are the dominant factor in driving the wage gap. [#] (http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/08076.pdf)

Could there be any discrimination against women on the labor market?
--------

There is evidence for discrimination towards females. This is due to statistical discrimination or taste-based discrimination. Statistical discrimination arises from stereotypes and prejudices.  Taste-based discrimination covers the discriminatory viewpoints of customers, employees and employers. It describes the level evasiveness of having a minority co-worker, in this case a female individual, present in the workforce. 

Customers have a preference to get served by male individuals, they would pay higher prices when served by males rather than if they were to get served by females. This would lead to unprofitability when female presence is apparent, which causes employers to hire men more often than women. Male employees in turn want to get a compensation when working with women because wages would be lower when there is a female presence. Adding just one female could influence the wages in such a way that the optimal allocation of workforce becomes a separation between man and women. Segregation causes a separate male and female workplace, which causes a gap between wages. Employers could also simply prefer male employees, based on a bias they have on males and females on the workforce.  [#] (https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&lr=&id=50qHcSNVVEMC&oi=fnd&pg=PP7&dq=becker+discrimination&ots=EQmTMbevEq&sig=3XJrYLRl8wX9xo19PeshqUQrs7c#v=onepage&q=becker%20discrimination&f=false)  Goldin and Rouse point out in a study, a phenomenon where males are preferred over women. However, there is no difference if the characteristics of being a male and female are hidden, thus forcing employers to judge the applicant based on its skills. This explains the employers' preferences for men over women. [#] (http://www.nber.org/papers/w5903)
Company size and culture also matters. Affirmative action is a policy which resulted by government regulation that made sure that minorities would get hired. Women got hired more often than without affirmative action. The effect was significant, as it increased the number of women in male dominated jobs by 8% to 20%.  [#] (https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/hiring/affirmativeact) [#] (http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/17/affirmative-action-has-helped-white-women-more-than-anyone/) Affirmative action could also have some discriminatory effect itself. A study has shown that minorities under affirmative action needed lower SAT-scores to get accepted for the same position. [#] (http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9072.html) This effect of reverse discrimination could lead to inequality between man and women based on effort and not on preferences as it was the case previously.


How did the wage gap change over years?
- 
Over time traditional households were fading away and more women decided to join the workforce as the 70's inspired women to feel free and focus more on their own lives. In the following graph, you can see the full time labor force participation on the y-axis and the time periods in decades on the x-axes. The graph illustrates an increase of the female workforce in full-time jobs, thus eroding the wage gap. [#] (http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/GenderGap.html). 

![#](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/art/lfHendersonCEE2_figure_025.jpg)

The wage gap is represented below. The ratio of female-to-male median earnings for full time workers is displayed along the y-axes. The x-axis shows the time over a period in decades. The graph is positive related to the percentage of full-time women in the workforce. Although no data exists for any date before the 1950's. There is a correlation present between the two phenomena.

How does maternity leave impact the workforce?
- 


In the United States, mother get a period of absence from their jobs during their last and first months of childbirth. In most countries women get paid a share of their monthly income, but in the United States there is a mandate of 12 weeks of unpaid maternity leave.  This parental leave system is a result of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Prior to this legislation, employer policies and collective bargaining were governing the maternity leave coverages. Currently there are just 14 states which passed state bills, in order to achieve some compensation in the form of paid leave. This still leaves the United States as one of the worst countries for women in terms of parental leave benefits and it is also the only developed country without any federal paid leave. [#] (http://www.nationalpartnership.org/research-library/work-family/expecting-better.pdf) The Family and Medical Leave Act caused a decrease in workforce with women with children younger than six, the first time in decades. [#] (https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/bejeap/v10y2010i1n6.html). A study has found adverse effects due to this bill and suggests that a new mandate might have shifted the behavior of employers, such that women would receive less benefits ex-post. [#] (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092753710300037X)


Employers are also anticipating women getting pregnant and are compensating for their loss in labor ex-ante. Employers could reduce wages or change hiring practices, as women tend to have smaller career path then men, due to childbirth and having to take care of children. This also takes into account any possible prospect for future promotions. [#] (https://hbr.org/1989/01/management-women-and-the-new-facts-of-life) The quality of maternity leave is thus negatively associated with median income of females. [#] (http://www.jstor.org/stable/2657300?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) [#] (https://izajole.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40172-015-0029-1) Although the US maternity leave affects women negatively, this effect fades away after the children have reached the age of 6 [#] (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11150-007-9023-0) 



What is the impact of the wage gap on the economy in the United States?
-

A study found that American women make 1.200.000 dollars less in the course of a 35-year career. Closing the wage gap could induce women to work more as they make up for 80% of the population of welfare recipients and 70% of Medicaid. This would lead to an increase of the GDP in the United States by 3% to 4%. This is significant when compared to Barrack Obama's stimulus package. This 800-billion-dollar bill lead to an increase of the GDP by 1.4% [#] (http://www.aauw.org/GraduatetoaPayGap/upload/AAUWGraduatingtoaPayGapReport.pdf) [#] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/gender-wage-gap-economic-stimulus_n_2007588.html) The wage disparity also continues in the retirement stages, where women receive just above 70% of the benefits of male retirees. [#] (http://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/f6fda396-2623-4e99-817e-bf9387360326/equal-pay-day-2011final.pdf)


Can policy makers in the United States close the wage gap?
-
There are several ways to help bridge the wage gap besides applying affirmative action. The Paycheck Fairness Act could provide improvements to the Equal Pay Act. [#] (https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s862/summary) [#] (https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm). The Paycheck Fairness Act, was a labor law introduced in 2016 by the Obama administration with its goal, to close the wage gap. The Paycheck Fairness Act's core provisions were to train women to negotiate their wages and to punish employees for openly discriminating on the wages based on their employees’ sex. These legislations are outdated as negotiation and discrimination standards were set prior to the law. New reforms should be implemented which considers individual choices made by both male and female employees and perhaps making some jobs more family friendly in term of benefits. 

The Equal Pay Act, a labor law aimed at abolishing wage disparities between sexes, has not seen an update since 1963. Supporters of this bill point out that it leads to closing the wage gap from 62% to 80% according to a survey from the Census Bureau [#] (http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/acs-09.pdf). However recent evidence suggest that men prefer more blue collar jobs and are more likely to participate in STEM (Science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields than women. STEM jobs have more working hours and higher salaries. The actual wage gap lies around 7%, when controlled for these omitted variables [#] (http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf). The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, was a legislation signed by Barack Obama, which gave the opportunity to women to receive 6 months’ worth of salary, if discriminatory practices targeting them were found. However, this is not a solution, nor a step in the right direction. This is simply an outdated lawsuit practice, which might threaten employers not to deviate from the contents of The Equal Pay Act, but it does not strengthen women’s position in the job market, nor does is close the wage gap. This became another law to enforce the old system of checks and balances, but does not provide opportunities for women to close the wage gap via their own initiative. [#] (https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/brochure-equal_pay_and_ledbetter_act.cfm) One of the priorities of policy makers could be to incentivize young girls towards STEM-related career paths.
